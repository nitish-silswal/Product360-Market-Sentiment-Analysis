  Very good product. I have used almost every brand the last 4 or 5 years but at Last I feel myself ""I'm back to my home after a very long journey"". Best built quality, best camera(but use gcam), very nice design, perfect size, nice display, very good performance. Snapdragon 636 from nokia is far faster n better in all respect than a Snapdragon 660AIE processor of Xiaomi mi à2 or Redmi note 7s or 7. I use both these phones and I'm talking exactly what I experience practically in real life. Moreover the 48mp camera from redmi note 7pro is incomparable with Nokia's 16mp while using Gcam. Even older Nokia 6.1(non plus model) beats the camera of note 7 pro both front and rear. I suggest don't even hope to bring note7 pro's gimmick 48mp near nokia 6.1plus. Everything is perfect with this phone. But the battery life will be a deal breaker for many of the our youths as they will charge twice a day(PUBG!!!!). That's why I'm reducing one 🌟. But for me it's quite easy to manage for one day usage as I previously use iPhone 7. I don't know why many costumers  in amazon are ruining this very good phone. They have made change many people's minds so that they(many people) left this Nokia 6.1plus from the best seller (Apario) of amazon for an alternative phone. I suggest this phone to everyone. Don't go wrong, don't trust these ill reviews and comments. Just buy and try one you won't feel repentant.

  Dislike because Quality is not good. I tried to return nokia 6.1 plus mobile phone but amazon saying the electronic items are not returnable. Please purchase through other online shopping like flipkart  snapdeal etc don't purchase through amazon. If you are interested to purchase/buy any electronic items like mobile phone, laptop etc. Please go for other shopping site like flipkart not purchase through Amazon  i am unappy because i selected the amazon online shopping and purchase a mobile phone of nokia 6.1 plus 6gb ram but i don't like this mobile phone be cause it is small in size . Front Camera. Photo Quality is not good in night time or in low light time. The rear camera is also like same. One more things when you are taking picture in room the photo quality is not coming good as per mentioned 16 mega pixel camera. When you take the photo outside the picture quality is really good . The mobile is hitting to much when you compare with other mobiles like samsung vivo oppo .

Best built quality, best camera(but use gcam), very nice design, perfect size, nice display, very good performance. Snapdragon 636 from nokia is far faster n better in all respect than a Snapdragon 660AIE processor of Xiaomi mi à2 or Redmi note 7s or 7. I use both these phones and I'm talking exactly what I experience practically in real life. Moreover the 48mp camera from redmi note 7pro is incomparable with Nokia's 16mp while using Gcam. Even older Nokia 6.1(non plus model) beats the camera of note 7 pro both front and rear. I suggest don't even hope to bring note7 pro's gimmick 48mp near nokia 6.1plus. Everything is perfect with this phone. But the battery life will be a deal breaker for many of the our youths as they will charge twice a day(PUBG!!!!). That's why I'm reducing one 🌟. But for me it's quite easy to manage for one day usage as I previously use iPhone 7. I don't know why many costumers  in amazon are ruining this very good phone. They have made change many people's minds so that they(many people) left this Nokia 6.1plus from the best seller (Apario) of amazon for an alternative phone. I suggest this phone to everyone. Don't go wrong, don't trust these ill reviews and comments. Just buy and try one you won't feel repentant.

  Dislike because Quality is not good. I tried to return nokia 6.1 plus mobile phone but amazon saying the electronic items are not returnable. Please purchase through other online shopping like flipkart  snapdeal etc don't purchase through amazon. If you are interested to purchase/buy any electronic items like mobile phone, laptop etc. Please go for other shopping site like flipkart not purchase through Amazon  i am unappy because i selected the amazon online shopping and purchase a mobile phone of nokia 6.1 plus 6gb ram but i don't like this mobile phone be cause it is small in size . Front Camera. Photo Quality is not good in night time or in low light time. The rear camera is also like same. One more things when you are taking picture in room the photo quality is not coming good as per mentioned 16 mega pixel camera. When you take the photo outside the picture quality is really good . The mobile is hitting to much when you compare with other mobiles like samsung vivo oppo .

  I earlier had iphone 5s with just 5 MP camera. The photos taken by that phone are much much better than this 12 MP phone. Please donot buy this phone if you take lot of photos from phone.Unfortunately I can't return it now. :(

  Very good product. I have used almost every brand the last 4 or 5 years but at Last I feel myself ""I'm back to my home after a very long journey"". Best built quality, best camera(but use gcam), very nice design, perfect size, nice display, very good performance. Snapdragon 636 from nokia is far faster n better in all respect than a Snapdragon 660AIE processor of Xiaomi mi à2 or Redmi note 7s or 7.
